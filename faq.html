                    <div class="faq-question">2. Why are there different prices for the same product? Is it legal?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">BuyBuy cart allows independent sellers from all over the places to sell their products on this online platform. The prices of the products are only decided by the seller itself. It may be possible that the same product is being sold at different prices by different sellers. By fulfilling all the legal requirements UdharPe allows all the sellers to present their product on this online marketplace.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">As UdharPe allows sellers to sell their products at their choice of price, it is possible that a particular style of an item is being sold at different prices by multiple sellers. The price appearing on the page may not be the lowest price of the product for that particular design. This happens as we select which seller's price will be displayed. This is done based on various parameters and price is only being considered as one such parameter. Furthermore, you can see various prices offered by different sellers for a particular design once you click on the item.</div>

UdharPe never asks for such confidential information from a customer. If you have already made such a mistake then immediately inform it to an appropriate law enforcement agency.
